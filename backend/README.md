Make sure that you're working in the backend directory :)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies using npm (`npm install`) or yarn (`yarn`).
2. Copy the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`. Update any of the fields if required. An up to date version of this file can be found in the shared google drive.

## Scripts

Run the scripts using `npm run <script>` or `yarn <script>`.

-   `dev` - Runs the backend api with hot-reloading (Automatically restarts as you make changes).
-   `build` - Compiles the Typescript into Javascript.
-   `start` - Runs the latest built code. (Make sure to use `build` before running so that it's up to date).
