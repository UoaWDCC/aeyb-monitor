# Shared

**NOTE**: This folder is for shared types only. i.e. interfaces, and type declarations. No enums, functions, variables, etc.

These types are shared between the frontend and backend. To use these, you can import it with `@shared` from both the frontend and the backend.

For example: `import {Permissions} from "@shared/utils/Permission"`
