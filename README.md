## Setup

1. To install the git submodules, run the following commands: 
   ```sh
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```
    To update the submodules if there are changes in the future, run `git submodule update --remote`

1. Make sure you have the all the dependencies installed by doing either `npm install` or `yarn`, first within the root directory and then in the `frontend` or `backend` directories, depending on which you're working with.

    > **Note** 
    > You'll likely only need to install the root dependencies once.
